        I’m Nishita Gupta, an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at 
        Vellore Institute of Technology, Andhra Pradesh. I’m passionate about solving real-world 
        problems through data analysis and technology. Alongside my strong foundation in Python 
        and analytics, I’ve recently expanded into web development — building full-stack applications 
        using React, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Tailwind CSS. 
        With a blend of technical skills, creativity, and a deep curiosity for learning, 
        I strive to create meaningful and user-friendly digital experiences. I’m eager to 
        grow through hands-on projects and contribute to innovative solutions wherever I go.
